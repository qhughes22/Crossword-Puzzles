Things are going pretty well with Aaron. He was gone for about 5 days and didn't complete the work we agreed on for the working prototype,
but he was clearly working hard and was using new classes that neither of us were familiar with. I don't have any complaints about working
with him. Since we live on the same floor we've been coordinating very well.
